In this problem, youâ€™ll write a program in the file khansole_academy.py that randomly generates simple addition problems for the user, 
reads in the answer from the user, and then checks to see if they got it right or wrong, until the user appears to have mastered the material. 

More specifically, your program should be able to generate simple addition problems that involve adding two 2-digit integers (i.e., the numbers 10 through 99). 
The user should be asked for an answer to each problem. Your program should determine if the answer was
correct or not, and give the user an appropriate message to let them know. Your program
should keep giving the user problems until the user has gotten 3 problems correct in a row.
